# Generative-AI
# Generative AI

This project explores **Generative Artificial Intelligence** — systems that can create new text, images, or other content based on input data. The goal of this repository is to learn and demonstrate how generative models such as GPT, DALL·E, and diffusion models work.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The project includes:
- Examples of text generation using open AI models.
- Simple experiments with image generation.
- Notes and explanations about model training, fine-tuning, and ethical considerations.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Understand how generative models are built and trained.
- Test small generative AI tools or APIs.
- Share insights, code, and experiments related to creative AI applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenAI API / Hugging Face models
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for analysis and visualization)

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/generative-ai.git
   cd generative-ai
